Welcome to my research repository! 

This repo serves as a collection of my published work in the field of **AI for Neurodegenerative Disease Prediction**. My first-authored and co-authored papers focusing on **feature selection, explainability in deep learning, and transfer learning for cognitive decline prediction using MRI data** are present here.
